# ModuleCode
This program can be uploaded on any ESP based microcontroller. The microntroller can communicate with any medical instrument that uses the ASTM and HL7 format. The communication can be both unidirectional and bidirectional depending on the requirement. This eliminates the need of buying a computer solely for the purpose of interfacing thereby reducing costs dramatically.
You can also update the data parser code as per your requirements.
